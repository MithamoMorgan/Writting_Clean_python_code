## Introduction

I have observed that significant portion of my working time is spent waiting for my code to finish running. Additionally, I've noticed that many works are challenging to understand due to lack of explanation. I believe that writing efficient python code can help reduce runtime and save computational resources, ultimately freeing more meaningful tasks as a Data Scientist.

One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written. The guidlines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code. A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important.

However, know when to be consistent, sometimes a style guide recommendations just aren't applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgement. Look at other examples and decide what looks best.

## General Tips for Clean code:

### 1. Follow PEP 8:
    Adhere to pythons style guide, PEP 8. It covers conventions for naming, identation, and other aspects of writting clean and readable code.
